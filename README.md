C++ ELF parser
===
This project is an ascetic elf file reader (compilable on both - Unix and Windows) aimed to get access to function information, namely - their names, size and virtual addresses within elf image.
It came out of a [micro-profiler](https://github.com/tyoma/micro-profiler) project while porting it to Linux.
